# Congress Trade Tracker

The STOCK (Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge) Act was passed in 2012 by President Obama. 

Every politician in Congress is required to disclose any stock exchanges or trades they make. 

The information is free to view on a government website

The goal of the act was to prevent insider trading in Congress. 

The following year, another act was supposed to be passed to organize this data in a database for better transparency with the American people. 

Unfortunately, that act was unanimously repealed by both houses of Congress.

My goal is to create a database using the raw data that they do give us to make the data transparent to everyone.
